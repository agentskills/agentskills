description: "The complete format specification for Agent Skills."
---

This document defines the Agent Skills format.

## Directory structure

A skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md          # Required
```

<Tip>
You can optionally include [additional directories](#optional-directories) such as `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to support your skill.
</Tip>

## SKILL.md format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: A description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

With optional fields:

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
---
```

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must not start or end with a hyphen. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 characters. Non-empty. Describes what the skill does and when to use it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to a bundled license file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access, etc.). |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited list of pre-approved tools the skill may use. (Experimental) |
| `level` | No | Integer 1-3 indicating composition tier. See [Composability](#composability-fields). |
| `operation` | No | Safety classification: `READ`, `WRITE`, or `TRANSFORM`. See [Composability](#composability-fields). |
| `composes` | No | List of skill names this skill uses. See [Composability](#composability-fields). |

#### `name` field

The required `name` field:
- Must be 1-64 characters
- May only contain unicode lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`a-z` and `-`)
- Must not start or end with `-`
- Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
- Must match the parent directory name

Valid examples:
```yaml
name: pdf-processing
```
```yaml
name: data-analysis
```
```yaml
name: code-review
```

Invalid examples:
```yaml
name: PDF-Processing  # uppercase not allowed
```
```yaml
name: -pdf  # cannot start with hyphen
```
```yaml
name: pdf--processing  # consecutive hyphens not allowed
```

#### `description` field

The required `description` field:
- Must be 1-1024 characters
- Should describe both what the skill does and when to use it
- Should include specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks

Good example:
```yaml
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

Poor example:
```yaml
description: Helps with PDFs.
```

#### `license` field

The optional `license` field:
- Specifies the license applied to the skill
- We recommend keeping it short (either the name of a license or the name of a bundled license file)

Example:
```yaml
license: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms
```

#### `compatibility` field

The optional `compatibility` field:
- Must be 1-500 characters if provided
- Should only be included if your skill has specific environment requirements
- Can indicate intended product, required system packages, network access needs, etc.

Examples:
```yaml
compatibility: Designed for Claude Code (or similar products)
```
```yaml
compatibility: Requires git, docker, jq, and access to the internet
```

<Note>
Most skills do not need the `compatibility` field.
</Note>

#### `metadata` field

The optional `metadata` field:
- A map from string keys to string values
- Clients can use this to store additional properties not defined by the Agent Skills spec
- We recommend making your key names reasonably unique to avoid accidental conflicts

Example:
```yaml
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
```

#### `allowed-tools` field

The optional `allowed-tools` field:
- A space-delimited list of tools that are pre-approved to run
- Experimental. Support for this field may vary between agent implementations

Example:
```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read
```

### Composability fields

These optional fields enable **composable skills** - building complex behaviours from simpler ones, like higher-order functions in functional programming. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design rationale.

#### `level` field

The optional `level` field indicates where a skill sits in the composition hierarchy:

| Value | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `1` | Atomic | Single-purpose operation (e.g., read emails, save PDF) |
| `2` | Composite | Combines multiple atomic skills (e.g., research = search + fetch) |
| `3` | Workflow | Complex orchestration with decision logic (e.g., daily synthesis) |

Example:
```yaml
level: 2
```

<Tip>
Level 1 skills should do ONE thing. Level 2+ skills should always specify `composes` to declare their dependencies.
</Tip>

#### `operation` field

The optional `operation` field classifies the skill's safety level:

| Value | Description | User Confirmation |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `READ` | Only reads data, no side effects | Never required |
| `WRITE` | Creates, modifies, or deletes data | Recommended |
| `TRANSFORM` | Local-only transformation | Never required |

Example:
```yaml
operation: READ
```

For composite skills, the operation should be the **most restrictive** of its components:
- If ANY component is WRITE → skill is WRITE
- If ALL components are READ → skill is READ

<Note>
This enables clients to automatically determine which skills need confirmation before execution.
</Note>

#### `composes` field

The optional `composes` field lists the skills this skill depends on:

```yaml
composes:
  - web-search
  - pdf-save
  - email-read
```

Benefits of explicit composition:
- **Auditable**: See exactly what capabilities a skill uses
- **Testable**: Verify all dependencies are available before activation
- **Upgradeable**: Know what's affected when changing a skill

<Warning>
Skills cannot compose themselves. Circular dependencies are not allowed.
</Warning>

#### Composability example

Here's a complete example of a Level 2 composite skill:

```yaml
---
name: research
description: Research a topic with web search and source archival. Use for comprehensive topic investigation.
level: 2
operation: READ
composes:
  - web-search
  - pdf-save
license: Apache-2.0
---

# Research

Comprehensive topic research with optional source archival.

## Workflow

1. Use **web-search** to get synthesised answer with citations
2. Optionally fetch full content from top citations
3. If requested, use **pdf-save** to archive sources

## When to use

Use this skill when the user needs:
- In-depth research on a topic
- Verified sources for claims
- Archived copies of web sources
```

### Body content

The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no format restrictions. Write whatever helps agents perform the task effectively.

Recommended sections:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples of inputs and outputs
- Common edge cases

Note that the agent will load this entire file once it's decided to activate a skill. Consider splitting longer `SKILL.md` content into referenced files.

## Optional directories

### scripts/

Contains executable code that agents can run. Scripts should:
- Be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
- Include helpful error messages
- Handle edge cases gracefully

Supported languages depend on the agent implementation. Common options include Python, Bash, and JavaScript.

### references/

Contains additional documentation that agents can read when needed:
- `REFERENCE.md` - Detailed technical reference
- `FORMS.md` - Form templates or structured data formats
- Domain-specific files (`finance.md`, `legal.md`, etc.)

Keep individual [reference files](#file-references) focused. Agents load these on demand, so smaller files mean less use of context.

### assets/

Contains static resources:
- Templates (document templates, configuration templates)
- Images (diagrams, examples)
- Data files (lookup tables, schemas)

## Progressive disclosure

Skills should be structured for efficient use of context:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): The `name` and `description` fields are loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens recommended): The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated
3. **Resources** (as needed): Files (e.g. those in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`) are loaded only when required

Keep your main `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

## File references

When referencing other files in your skill, use relative paths from the skill root:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.

Run the extraction script:
scripts/extract.py
```

Keep file references one level deep from `SKILL.md`. Avoid deeply nested reference chains.

## Validation

Use the [skills-ref](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) reference library to validate your skills:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

This checks that your `SKILL.md` frontmatter is valid and follows all naming conventions.
