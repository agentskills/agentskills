This guide focuses on writing high-quality skills that route correctly, stay concise in context, and execute reliably.

## Start with the right structure

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` file. Keep optional folders flat and one level deep.

```directory
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md       # Required: metadata + core workflow
├── scripts/       # Optional: deterministic executable helpers
├── references/    # Optional: supplemental docs loaded on demand
└── assets/        # Optional: templates and static output resources
```

Use `SKILL.md` as the control plane for routing and workflow. Move bulky details to `references/`, reusable execution logic to `scripts/`, and output artifacts to `assets/`.

## Optimize metadata for routing

Agents discover skills from frontmatter, so `name` and `description` must be precise.

- `name`: keep it valid per spec and identical to the skill directory name.
- `description`: describe what the skill does, when it should trigger, and nearby cases where it should not trigger.

Good descriptions are concrete and specific to domain terminology. Vague descriptions make the skill difficult to route.

## Design for progressive disclosure

Treat context like a scarce resource.

1. Keep `SKILL.md` focused and generally under 500 lines.
2. Link detailed material from `SKILL.md` into files in `references/`.
3. Reference files directly from `SKILL.md` (avoid deep reference chains).
4. Tell the agent exactly when to read each file.

Example:

```mdx
For API error codes, read [references/errors.md](references/errors.md).
For migration flags, read [references/migrations.md](references/migrations.md).
```

## Write instructions for agents, not humans

Prefer deterministic, procedural instructions over prose.

- Use numbered steps with clear sequencing.
- Use explicit branch points (`if/then`) for decision paths.
- Keep terminology consistent across the skill.
- Prefer concrete templates in `assets/` over long descriptive text.

## Use scripts for fragile or repetitive work

If failure modes are costly or code is repeatedly regenerated, bundle a script in `scripts/`.

- Keep scripts small and single-purpose.
- Emit clear, actionable error messages.
- Handle known edge cases so the agent can recover without user intervention.

Avoid embedding large library-style code inside skills. Place durable libraries in normal project repositories and call them from scripts when needed.

## Keep skills lean

Skills are execution artifacts for agents. Avoid extra documents that bloat discovery and maintenance overhead.

Do not add files like:
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`

If an instruction is redundant with baseline model capability, remove it.

## Validate before publishing

Validate both routing quality and execution quality.

1. Discovery validation: test whether prompts that should trigger your skill do trigger, and near-neighbor prompts do not.
2. Logic validation: simulate step-by-step execution and identify where instructions force guessing.
3. Edge-case validation: stress unsupported configurations and failure paths.
4. Refinement: move dense details out of `SKILL.md` and keep it focused on high-level control flow.

You can also run the reference validator:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```
