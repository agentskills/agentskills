# Contributing Skills

You can contribute skills while staying entirely in Tier 1. No category theory, monads, or type theory required.

## Minimal Checklist

Before submitting a PR with new skills:

- [ ] Each skill has a valid `SKILL.md` with required fields
- [ ] Types are defined for all inputs/outputs
- [ ] `composes:` references exist and are valid
- [ ] Tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Level constraints respected (L2 composes L1 only, etc.)

## Adding a Level 1 Atomic Skill

### Step 1: Create the skill folder

```bash
mkdir -p examples/_showcase/your-domain/_atomic/your-skill/
```

### Step 2: Write SKILL.md

```yaml
# examples/_showcase/your-domain/_atomic/your-skill/SKILL.md
name: your-skill
level: 1
operation: READ  # or WRITE

description: |
  One sentence describing what this skill does.

inputs:
  - name: input_name
    type: string
    required: true
    description: What this input represents

outputs:
  - name: output_name
    type: object
    properties:
      field1: string
      field2: integer
    description: What this output contains

examples:
  - input:
      input_name: "example value"
    output:
      output_name:
        field1: "result"
        field2: 42
```

### Step 3: Add tests

```python
# examples/_showcase/your-domain/tests/test_your_skill.py
import pytest
from pathlib import Path
import yaml

def test_skill_structure():
    skill_path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "_atomic/your-skill/SKILL.md"
    with open(skill_path) as f:
        skill = yaml.safe_load(f)

    assert skill["name"] == "your-skill"
    assert skill["level"] == 1
    assert "inputs" in skill
    assert "outputs" in skill

def test_skill_has_required_fields():
    # Validate all required fields present
    ...

def test_skill_types_valid():
    # Validate type definitions
    ...
```

### Step 4: Run validation

```bash
pytest examples/_showcase/your-domain/tests/ -v
```

## Adding a Level 2 Composite Skill

Composites combine atomics. They only reference L1 skills.

```yaml
# examples/_showcase/your-domain/_composite/combined-skill/SKILL.md
name: combined-skill
level: 2
operation: READ  # Maximum of composed skills

description: |
  Combines skill-a and skill-b for a higher-level operation.

composes:
  - skill-a    # Must be L1
  - skill-b    # Must be L1

inputs:
  - name: query
    type: string
    required: true

outputs:
  - name: combined_result
    type: object
```

**Key constraint:** L2 skills can only compose L1 skills.

## Adding a Level 3 Workflow

Workflows orchestrate composites with state management.

```yaml
# examples/_showcase/your-domain/_workflows/full-workflow/SKILL.md
name: full-workflow
level: 3
operation: WORKFLOW

description: |
  End-to-end workflow with state transitions.

composes:
  - combined-skill    # L2
  - another-composite # L2

states:
  - INITIAL
  - PROCESSING
  - COMPLETE

initial_state: INITIAL

transitions:
  - from: INITIAL
    to: PROCESSING
    when: START
  - from: PROCESSING
    to: COMPLETE
    when: DONE
```

## Example PR: Adding a New Skill

Here's what a typical contribution PR looks like:

```
feat: Add weather-forecast L1 skill to Trip Optimizer

Added:
- _atomic/weather-forecast/SKILL.md
- tests/test_weather_forecast.py

The skill fetches weather data for a location and date range.
Used by the existing destination-research L2 composite.

Tests: 4 new tests, all passing
```

**Files changed:**
```
examples/_showcase/trip-optimizer/
├── _atomic/
│   └── weather-forecast/
│       └── SKILL.md          # New skill definition
└── tests/
    └── test_weather_forecast.py  # New tests
```

## What You Don't Need to Touch

As a Tier 1 contributor, you never need to:

- Understand or modify the categorical core
- Write monad implementations
- Define type system rules
- Touch the validation framework internals

**Focus on:** SKILL.md files, tests, and ensuring your skills compose correctly.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| L2 composing another L2 | Move logic to L1 atomics, compose those |
| Missing `required: true` on mandatory inputs | Add the field |
| WRITE skill without `confirmation_required` | Add explicit confirmation setting |
| Tests only check structure | Add semantic tests for your domain |

## Getting Help

- **Validation errors unclear?** Check the FAQ
- **Unsure about levels?** Look at existing showcases for patterns
- **Type system questions?** The FAQ covers polymorphism and subtyping

## Review Criteria

When reviewing skill contributions, maintainers check:

1. **Structure valid** - SKILL.md parses and has required fields
2. **Types defined** - All inputs/outputs have explicit types
3. **Composition valid** - Referenced skills exist at correct levels
4. **Tests present** - At least structure + one semantic test
5. **Documentation** - Clear description and examples
