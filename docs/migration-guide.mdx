# Migration Guide

This guide provides a progressive adoption pathway from existing AI tools to Agent Skills. Based on enterprise adoption patterns, we recommend a three-tier approach over 12 weeks.

<Note>
**Reality Check:** 96% of enterprises are in experimentation; only 2.9% have reached scale. This guide closes that gap by providing concrete migration steps with validated outcomes at each stage.
</Note>

## Migration Paths

| Coming From | Complexity | Timeline |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Custom GPTs / Claude Projects** | Low | 1-2 weeks |
| **LangChain / LlamaIndex** | Medium | 2-4 weeks |
| **Raw API calls** | Medium | 2-4 weeks |
| **CrewAI / AutoGen** | Medium | 3-5 weeks |
| **Custom agent framework** | High | 4-8 weeks |

## Tier 1: Single Skill (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Convert one existing workflow to Agent Skills format.

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Workflow

Choose a workflow that:
- ✅ Runs frequently (daily or more)
- ✅ Has clear inputs and outputs
- ✅ Is currently working (don't fix bugs during migration)
- ✅ Is low-risk (READ operations preferred)

**Good first candidates:**
- Data retrieval (search, lookup)
- Report generation
- Status summaries
- Classification tasks

### Step 2: Extract the Skill Definition

**From Custom GPT:**

```
GPT Instructions:
"When the user asks about a customer, search the CRM for their
information and summarize their account status, recent interactions,
and any open issues."
```

**To SKILL.md:**

```yaml
name: customer-lookup
level: 1
operation: READ

description: |
  Retrieves customer information from CRM and summarizes
  account status, recent interactions, and open issues.

inputs:
  - name: customer_id
    type: string
    required: true
    description: "Customer ID or email"

outputs:
  - name: summary
    type: object
    properties:
      account_status: string
      recent_interactions: array
      open_issues: array

examples:
  - input:
      customer_id: "acme-corp"
    output:
      summary:
        account_status: "Active - Enterprise"
        recent_interactions: ["Call 2025-12-20", "Email 2025-12-18"]
        open_issues: ["Ticket #1234 - API rate limiting"]
```

### Step 3: Validate and Test

```bash
# Validate skill structure
agentskills validate skills/customer-lookup/

# Run with test input
agentskills run customer-lookup --input '{"customer_id": "test-123"}'

# Compare output with existing system
# Ensure parity before proceeding
```

### Step 4: Measure Baseline

Record these metrics for later comparison:
- Execution time
- Token usage
- Error rate
- Output quality (manual review)

---

## Tier 2: Composite Skill (Week 3-6)

**Goal:** Build a workflow that chains 2-3 atomic skills.

### Step 1: Map the Workflow

Identify the steps in your existing workflow:

```
Existing: "When a support ticket comes in, look up the customer,
check their recent interactions, and draft a response."

Steps:
1. customer-lookup (L1) - Get customer context
2. ticket-read (L1) - Get ticket details
3. response-draft (L1) - Generate response
```

### Step 2: Create L1 Skills for Each Step

If skills don't exist, create them following Tier 1 pattern.

### Step 3: Compose into L2

```yaml
# support-response/SKILL.md
name: support-response
level: 2
operation: READ

description: |
  Handles incoming support tickets by gathering customer context
  and drafting an appropriate response.

composes:
  - customer-lookup
  - ticket-read
  - response-draft

inputs:
  - name: ticket_id
    type: string
    required: true

outputs:
  - name: draft_response
    type: string
  - name: customer_context
    type: object
  - name: suggested_priority
    type: string
    enum: [low, medium, high, urgent]
```

### Step 4: Add Type Mappings

Ensure outputs of each skill match inputs of the next:

```yaml
# In composition config
mappings:
  - from: customer-lookup.summary
    to: response-draft.customer_context
  - from: ticket-read.details
    to: response-draft.ticket_info
```

### Step 5: Validate Composition

```bash
# Check type flow
agentskills validate --check-types skills/support-response/

# Run end-to-end
agentskills run support-response --input '{"ticket_id": "T-12345"}'
```

---

## Tier 3: Multi-Agent System (Week 7-12)

**Goal:** Orchestrate specialized agents using skills with governance.

### Step 1: Design Agent Roles

Map your workflow to specialized agents:

```
Customer Success Agent
├── customer-intel (L2) - Aggregate customer context
├── renewal-risk (L2) - Assess renewal probability
└── expansion-opportunity (L2) - Identify upsell potential

Support Agent
├── support-triage (L2) - Classify and route tickets
├── support-response (L2) - Draft responses
└── escalation-decide (L2) - Determine escalation need
```

### Step 2: Create L3 Workflow

```yaml
# customer-success-workflow/SKILL.md
name: customer-success-workflow
level: 3
operation: WORKFLOW

description: |
  Full customer success workflow for account reviews.
  Orchestrates intelligence gathering, risk assessment,
  and action planning.

composes:
  - customer-intel
  - renewal-risk
  - expansion-opportunity
  - action-plan-generate

states:
  - GATHERING_CONTEXT
  - ANALYZING_RISK
  - IDENTIFYING_OPPORTUNITIES
  - PLANNING_ACTIONS
  - COMPLETE

transitions:
  - from: GATHERING_CONTEXT
    to: ANALYZING_RISK
    when: context_complete
  - from: ANALYZING_RISK
    to: IDENTIFYING_OPPORTUNITIES
    when: risk_assessed
  - from: IDENTIFYING_OPPORTUNITIES
    to: PLANNING_ACTIONS
    when: opportunities_identified
```

### Step 3: Add Governance

```yaml
# Governance configuration
governance:
  confirmation:
    required_for: [WRITE]
    timeout: 300s
    escalation: manager@company.com

  audit:
    log_all_executions: true
    retention_days: 90
    pii_redaction: true

  cost:
    budget_per_day: 100.00
    alert_at: [50, 80, 100]
```

### Step 4: Deploy with Feature Flags

```python
# Gradual rollout
from agentskills import SkillRunner, FeatureFlags

flags = FeatureFlags({
    "use_new_workflow": {
        "enabled": True,
        "rollout_percentage": 10,  # Start with 10%
        "allowed_users": ["beta-testers"]
    }
})

runner = SkillRunner(feature_flags=flags)
```

## Common Migration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Wrapper Skills

Wrap existing functionality without rewriting:

```yaml
name: legacy-api-wrapper
level: 1
operation: READ

implementation:
  type: http
  url: "https://legacy-api.internal/endpoint"
  method: POST
  headers:
    Authorization: "Bearer ${LEGACY_API_TOKEN}"
```

### Pattern 2: Gradual Replacement

Run old and new in parallel, compare results:

```python
async def migrate_with_comparison(inputs):
    # Run both
    old_result = await legacy_system.execute(inputs)
    new_result = await skill_runner.execute("new-skill", inputs)

    # Compare
    if not results_match(old_result, new_result):
        log_discrepancy(old_result, new_result)
        return old_result  # Fallback to old

    return new_result
```

### Pattern 3: Feature Flag Rollout

```yaml
# config/rollout.yaml
skills:
  customer-lookup:
    version: 2.0.0
    rollout:
      percentage: 25
      canary_users:
        - team-alpha@company.com
      fallback: customer-lookup@1.0.0
```
