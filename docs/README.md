# Agent Skills Documentation

This directory contains the source code for the Agent Skills documentation site, which is built using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com).

## Development

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```
npx mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

Changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

## Need help?

### Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `npx mint dev` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`.
