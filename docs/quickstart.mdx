# Quickstart: Your First Composed Skill

**Goal:** Run a working skill composition in under 10 minutes. Theory comes later.

> **Why this architecture?** AgentSkills follows [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) principles—the same thinking that transformed web services applies to AI agents. Instead of monolithic mega-prompts, we build **small, composable skills** with **strong contracts** and **clear safety boundaries**. Skills are portable across runtimes: the same definition works whether you're running locally, in Claude Code, or enterprise infrastructure.

<details>
<summary>**Design Principles (click to expand)**</summary>

- **Own your context** → Skills declare their inputs/outputs explicitly
- **Tools as structured outputs** → Type-safe contracts, not free-form text
- **Small focused agents** → L1 atomic skills do one thing well
- **Contact humans with tool calls** → WRITE operations require confirmation
- **Compose, don't concatenate** → L2/L3 skills compose atomics cleanly

</details>

## 0-2 Minutes: Run Your First Skill

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills
cd agentskills

# Run the hello-world example
python examples/quickstart/run_hello.py
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Skill loaded: hello-world
✅ Input validation passed
✅ Output: {"message": "Hello, World!", "timestamp": "2025-12-26T08:30:00Z"}
```

**What just happened?**
- Loaded a skill definition from `SKILL.md`
- Validated inputs against the schema
- Executed the skill
- Validated output

## 2-5 Minutes: Compose Two Skills

Now let's compose two skills together:

```bash
python examples/quickstart/run_composition.py
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Composing: fetch-weather → format-report
✅ Step 1: fetch-weather
   Input: {"location": "London"}
   Output: {"temp": 12, "conditions": "cloudy"}
✅ Step 2: format-report
   Input: {"temp": 12, "conditions": "cloudy"}
   Output: {"report": "London: 12°C, cloudy skies"}
✅ Composition complete!
```

**Look at the composition:**

```yaml
# examples/quickstart/weather-report/SKILL.md
name: weather-report
level: 2                    # L2 = composite skill
operation: READ             # Safe, no confirmation needed

composes:
  - fetch-weather           # L1: Get raw weather data
  - format-report           # L1: Format into human-readable

inputs:
  - name: location
    type: string
    required: true

outputs:
  - name: report
    type: string
```

**That's it.** Two skills composed with 4 lines of YAML.

## 5-8 Minutes: Create Your Own Skill

Create a new L1 skill:

```bash
mkdir -p examples/quickstart/my-skill
```

Create `examples/quickstart/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
name: greet-user
level: 1
operation: READ

description: |
  Generates a personalized greeting.

inputs:
  - name: username
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: formal
    type: boolean
    default: false

outputs:
  - name: greeting
    type: string

examples:
  - input:
      username: "Alice"
      formal: false
    output:
      greeting: "Hey Alice! 👋"
  - input:
      username: "Dr. Smith"
      formal: true
    output:
      greeting: "Good day, Dr. Smith."
```

Validate it:

```bash
python scripts/validate-skills.py examples/quickstart/my-skill/
```

**Output:**
```
✅ greet-user: Valid L1 skill
   - 2 inputs defined
   - 1 output defined
   - 2 examples provided
```

## 8-10 Minutes: Add It to a Composition

Now compose your skill with `format-report`:

Create `examples/quickstart/personalized-weather/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
name: personalized-weather
level: 2
operation: READ

composes:
  - greet-user              # Your new skill
  - fetch-weather
  - format-report

inputs:
  - name: username
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: location
    type: string
    required: true

outputs:
  - name: message
    type: string
```

Run it:

```bash
python examples/quickstart/run_personalized.py Alice London
```

**Output:**
```
Hey Alice! 👋 London: 12°C, cloudy skies
```

## Done! What's Next?

You just:
- ✅ Ran a skill
- ✅ Composed two skills
- ✅ Created your own skill
- ✅ Added it to a composition

## Reference: The 5 Things You Need

Now that you've seen it work, here's the mental model:

1. **Skills have inputs and outputs** → JSON Schema types
2. **Compose with `composes:`** → List skills in order
3. **Levels: L1 → L2 → L3** → Atomic → Composite → Workflow
4. **READ is safe, WRITE confirms** → Effect classification
5. **Validate before running** → `python scripts/validate-skills.py`

Everything else is optional depth. Start building.
