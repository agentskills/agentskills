This page defines a universal default directory for skills so that a single set of skills can be shared across tools.

## Why a universal directory

A shared default location reduces duplicated skill installs and makes skills portable across agents and editors. It also simplifies setup for users: install once, use everywhere.

## Default location

All tools should use the same default skill root:

- macOS and Linux: `~/.skills`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.skills`

The directory is user-scoped and does not require elevated permissions.

## Overrides

If the environment variable `AGENT_SKILLS_PATH` is set, tools should use it instead of the default root.

- It is a list of directories, separated by the OS path separator.
- POSIX separator: `:`
- Windows separator: `;`

Examples:

```bash
# POSIX
export AGENT_SKILLS_PATH="$HOME/.skills:$HOME/work/skills"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:AGENT_SKILLS_PATH = "$env:USERPROFILE\.skills;$env:USERPROFILE\work\skills"
```

## Discovery order

Tools should discover skills in the following order:

1. Tool-specific config or CLI flags (if provided)
2. `AGENT_SKILLS_PATH` (if set)
3. Default root (`~/.skills` or `%USERPROFILE%\.skills`)

Pseudocode:

```text
if tool_config_paths:
  use tool_config_paths
else if AGENT_SKILLS_PATH is set:
  split by OS separator and use those paths
else:
  use default_root
```

## Directory layout

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```directory
~/.skills/
├── pdf-processing/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── data-analysis/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## Migration guidance for existing tools

If a tool already has a private skill directory, it should:

- Continue to read the legacy directory for backward compatibility.
- Encourage users to move or sync skills into `~/.skills`.
- Prefer `~/.skills` (or `AGENT_SKILLS_PATH`) for new installs.

Symlinking the old directory into `~/.skills` is also an acceptable migration path on macOS and Linux.

## Error handling

- Ignore missing directories.
- Skip invalid skill folders that do not contain a valid `SKILL.md`.
- Optionally warn users when `AGENT_SKILLS_PATH` points to a non-existent directory.

## Non-goals

- System-wide skill directories shared across users.
- Networked or remote skill registries.
