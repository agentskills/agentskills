# Agent Skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) are a simple, open format for giving agents new capabilities and expertise.

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to perform better at specific tasks. Write once, use everywhere.

## Agent Skills vs AGENTS.md vs MCP

The AI agent ecosystem has several complementary standards. Here's how they differ:

| Standard | Purpose | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Agent Skills** | Teach agents *how* to do something | Reusable capabilities across projects |
| **[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md)** | Tell agents *what* to do in your codebase | Project-specific coding workflows |
| **[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)** | Give agents *access* to tools and data | External system integrations |

For a detailed comparison including feature tables, use cases, and how to combine these approaches, see the [Comparison Guide](docs/comparison-guide.md).
